# name_testing_artifacts

This repo shows what we did, including the testing code and test cases. But now, we are in the reporting stage, so we will not offer many details.

This version only contains representative examples (test cases) for tasks. We will use our paper's corresponding words/abbreviations to show the meanings for less disclosed words but illustrate our tests. If not a `ca*.pem` is not provided in the sub-folder, please use the `../baseChain/ca.pem` if a CA cert is needed. We cannot show the input strings for some tasks, so please see the paper for more description.

Each test case will provide a README. Please see this in the folders.
